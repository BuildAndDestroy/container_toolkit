Prerequisits

[*] docker-compose files for private registry
	https://github.com/justmeandopensource/docker/tree/master/docker-compose-files/docker-registry


[*] Create directories on kube-master and all nodes
	mkdir /mnt/docker-registry/certs

  If you have Ansible, run this to push to your k8s hosts:
	ansible -m shell -a "mkdir /mnt/docker-registry/certs" k8s-lehi-lab-hosts


[*] You need the following in your /etc/docker/daemon.json file:

	{"insecure-registries": ["hostORip:port"]}

  Example:
{
  "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"],
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "100m"
  },
  "storage-driver": "overlay2",
  "storage-opts": [
    "overlay2.override_kernel_check=true"
  ],
  "insecure-registries": ["10.204.119.86:5000"]
}

[*] docker-compose must be installed


Rough Guidelines on creating an internal registry

[*] Use the correct docker-compose file you need.
	Change the file name to:
		"docker-compose.yaml"
	On the master node, run the following to create your registry:
		"docker-compose up -d"

You now have a running registry.

[*] To use an image from this registry to create a pod, add an image like so:
	Build the image:
		docker build -t <ip/host of internal registry>:5000/mydebian:v1 .
		docker push <ip/host of internal registry>:5000/mydebian:v1

	Now pull the image into a pod:
		kubectl run mytest --image 10.204.119.86:5000/mydebian:v1

	Separate terminal, watch the events:
		kubectl get events -w
